####In addition to the MIT license following terms apply:
-  You can't distribute your or any deriviate (except for personal use of course)
This is to ensure this piece of software got all the good features and there aren't any deriviates that got not everything but like 60%.
I'm a big fan of including settings to en/disable functions, so __if__ your PR gets rejected (I don't think that will ever happen *[well if it's a serious PR]*) I'll most likely ask you to change it so it can be optional/configured
- You can do whatever you want with this software for personal use (or like with only friends, just not publicly availlable)
Because why wouldn't you be allowed? That would be just stupid.
